# Distributed Tree Diff

This is an attempt to implement a system that tracks changes in different
replicas of a tree structure, intended for file systems.

Many of the ideas here are based on this paper:

> D. Malkhi and D. Terry. Concise version vectors in WinFS. In *Distributed
> Computing*, 2005.

Which can be found [on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?cluster=15694180381552406021).

This librarly appears pretty stable now, but I cannot guarantee anything.
